This is a collection of settings, files, scripts and templates to use
with pandoc. The aim is to provide a consistent output no matter what
the format, without making compromises on typography.

Some filters used with these files are not provided in this repo (e.g. 
[pandoc-latex-environment](https://github.com/chdemko/pandoc-latex-environment/)).

I personally also use emacs' [pandoc-mode](https://github.com/joostkremers/pandoc-mode/).
But these templates and files can also be used without pandoc-mode (in
which case the Project.* files are useless as such). However, there
might be some good arguments you might want to take inspiration from
to execute the right pandoc commands.
