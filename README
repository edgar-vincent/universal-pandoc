This is a collection of settings, files, scripts and templates to use
with pandoc. The aim is to provide a consistent output no matter what
the format, without making compromises on typography.

Some filters used with these files are not provided in this repo (e.g. 
[pandoc-latex-environment](https://github.com/chdemko/pandoc-latex-environment/)).

See my [personal pandoc and latex template documents](https://github.com/hugoroy/pandoc-template-docs).
